# Overview
We have our own file server that can be accessed from anywhere, including from home. 

This can be accessed at <https://files.createoldham.com>.

The file server is based on an open-source piece of software called NextCloud, and you can find out more about them here: Nextcloud

As with all of the machines at Create Oldham, we have to work to a budget. This sometimes means that we have to use older equipment that often has lower specifications and be more prone to failure. For this reason, please remember that this server is not a backup solution and data may be lost due to hardware failure. You can protect your data against this by ensuring you keep a backup somewhere else. As with all of the infrastructure at Create, we do have monitoring in place in the hope we catch these issues early. 

All members have 5GB of storage available to them. This should be enough to store several vector files, 3D models or GCode. If you do have any storage issues, we do have some space overhead, so please get in touch with us using the details on the [Systems contact page](../../) and we can temporarily grant some more space.
