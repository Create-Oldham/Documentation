# Ender 3 Pro

We have 4 Ender 3 Pro FDM 3D Printers

Slicing can be done on your PC or the PC that is set up with the 3D Printers using [Creality Slicer](https://www.creality.com/download) (We use version xxx)

You can find the configuration that we use in the 3D Printer folder in [Nextcloud](https://files.createoldham.com)
