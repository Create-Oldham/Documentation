###  Adding Documentation

#### Overview 
<https://create-oldham.github.io/Documentation> is the home for documentation relating to Create Oldham.

It is hosted on github pages through mkdocs using the material theme.

#### Adding Documentation 

##### Github User

Simply create a pull request with a new markdown file in the documentation repository and we will pull it at the next scheduled update

##### Non github user 

Create a markdown file (try stackedit.io if you want  a wysiwyg editor) and simply email the markdown output to theboard@createoldham.com and we will add it to the repo on your behalf

Thanks to [Hackspace Manchester](https://www.hacman.org.uk/) for open sourcing their documentation, it proved very useful when we created ours.
