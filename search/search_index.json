The materials that the laser can cut materials like wood, paper, cork, and some kinds of plastics. Etching can be done on almost anything, wood, cardboard, aluminum, stainless steel, plastic, marble, stone, tile, and glass. Where to find materials There is a fairly good supply of materials at the hackerspace, which you can pay for in the store. If you need larger quantities or a unique material, you can try one of the places listed here: Safe materials to cut Material Max thickness Notes Warnings Many woods 1/4\" Avoid oily/resinous woods Be very careful about cutting oily woods, or very resinous woods as they also may catch fire. Plywood/Composite woods 1/4\" These contain glue, and may not laser cut as well as solid wood. MDF/Engineered woods 1/4\" These are okay to use but may experience a higher amount of charring when cut. Paper, card stock thin Cuts very well on the laser cutter, and also very quickly. Cardboard, carton thicker Cuts well but may catch fire. Watch for fire. Cork 1/4\" Cuts nicely, but the quality of the cut depends on the thickness and quality of the cork. Engineered cork has a lot of glue in it, and may not cut as well. Avoid thicker cork. Acrylic/Lucite/Plexiglas/PMMA 1/2\" Cuts extremely well leaving a beautifully polished edge. Thin Polycarbonate Sheeting (<1mm) <1mm Very thin polycarbonate can be cut, but tends to discolor badly. Extremely thin sheets (0.5mm and less) may cut with yellowed/discolored edges. Polycarbonate absorbs IR strongly, and is a poor material to use in the laser cutter. Watch for smoking/burning Delrin (POM) thin Delrin comes in a number of shore strengths (hardness) and the harder Delrin tends to work better. Great for gears! Kapton tape (Polyimide) 1/16\" Works well, in thin sheets and strips like tape. Mylar 1/16\" Works well if it's thin. Thick mylar has a tendency to warp, bubble, and curl Gold coated mylar will not work. Solid Styrene 1/16\" Smokes a lot when cut, but can be cut. Keep it thin. Depron foam 1/4\" Used a lot for hobby, RC aircraft, architectural models, and toys. 1/4\" cuts nicely, with a smooth edge. Must be constantly monitored. Gator foam Foam core gets burned and eaten away compared to the top and bottom hard paper shell. Not a fantastic thing to cut, but it can be cut if watched. Cloth/felt/hemp/cotton They all cut well. Our lasers can be used in lace-making. Not plastic coated or impregnated cloth! Leather/Suede 1/8\" Leather is very hard to cut, but can be if it's thinner than a belt (call it 1/8\"). Our \"Advanced\" laser training class covers this. Real leather only! Not 'pleather' or other imitations! Magnetic Sheet Cuts beautifully NON-CHLORINE-containing rubber Fine for cutting. Beware chlorine-containing rubber! Teflon (PTFE) thin Cuts OK in thin sheets.

You must not cut carbon fiber that has been coated!! Coroplast ('corrugated plastic') 1/4\" Difficult because of the vertical strips. Three passes at 80% power, 7% speed, and it will be slightly connected still at the bottom from the vertical strips. Etching Material Notes WARNINGS! Glass Green seems to work best...looks sandblasted. Only FLAT GLASS can be engraved in our cutter. No round or cylindrical items. Ceramic tile Anodized aluminum Vaporizes the anodization away. Painted/coated metals Vaporizes the paint away. Stone, Marble, Granite, Soapstone, Onyx. Gets a white \"textured\" look when etched. 100% power, 50% speed or less works well for etching.","title":"Safe Materials"},{"location":"Workshop/Laser%20Cutter/Safe%20Materials/#safe-materials","text":"The laser can cut or etch.

Cause/Consequence PVC (Poly Vinyl Chloride)/vinyl/pleather/artificial leather Emits chlorine gas when cut! Don't ever cut this material as it will ruin the optics, cause the metal of the machine to corrode, and ruin the motion control system. Thick ( >1mm ) Polycarbonate/Lexan Cuts very poorly, discolors, catches fire Polycarbonate is often found as flat, sheet material. The window of the laser cutter is made of Polycarbonate because polycarbonate strongly absorbs infrared radiation! This is the frequency of light the laser cutter uses to cut materials, so it is very ineffective at cutting polycarbonate. Polycarbonate is a poor choice for laser cutting. ABS Melts / Cyanide ABS does not cut well in a laser cutter. It tends to melt rather than vaporize, and has a higher chance of catching on fire and leaving behind melted gooey deposits on the vector cutting grid. It also does not engrave well (again, tends to melt). Also, cutting ABS plastic emits hydrogen cyanide, which is unsafe at any concentration. HDPE/milk bottle plastic Catches fire and melts It melts. It gets gooey. Don't use it. PolyStyrene Foam Catches fire It catches fire, it melts, and only thin pieces cut. This is the #1 material that causes laser fires!!! PolyPropylene Foam Catches fire Like PolyStyrene, it melts, catches fire, and the melted drops continue to burn and turn into rock-hard drips and pebbles. Epoxy burn / smoke Epoxy is an aliphatic resin, strongly cross-linked carbon chains. A CO2 laser can't cut it, and the resulting burned mess creates toxic fumes ( like cyanide! ).
